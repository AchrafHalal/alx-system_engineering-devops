# 0x0F. Load balancer

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of a load balancer. The load balancer distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers to increase capacity and reliability of applications.

## Features

* Efficient distribution of network or application traffic.
* Health checks to ensure only requests to healthy servers.
* SSL termination to reduce the load on backend servers.
* Session persistence to ensure a client consistently connects to the same server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AchrafHalal/alx-system_engineering-devops.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x0F-load_balancer`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python, etc.)

## Usage
